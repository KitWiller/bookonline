        "description": "for twenty years, the lessons from the pragmatic programmer have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology. this classic title is regularly featured on \"top ten\" lists, and many corporations issue it to their new hires.\n\r\nthis new 20th anniversary edition offers a fresh look at the modern development landscape, cutting through the \"business as usual\" and tired advice from the net to help guide you through the next twenty years and beyond. featuring new tips, new topics, and revisions throughout, you don't want to miss this one.\n\r\nandy and dave wrote this influential, classic book to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. almost twenty years later, its advice is still spot on, and the pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories.\n\r\nthis new edition examines the core of modern software development - understanding what is wanted and producing working, maintainable code that delights its users. it covers topics ranging from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. \n\r\nread this book, and you'll learn how to: fight software rot; learn continuously; avoid the trap of duplicating knowledge; write flexible, dynamic, and adaptable code; harness the power of basic tools; avoid programming by coincidence; learn real requirements; solve the underlying problems of concurrent code; guard against security vulnerabilities; build teams of pragmatic programmers; take responsibility for your work and career; test ruthlessly and effectively, including property-based testing; implement the pragmatic starter kit; delight your users.\n\r\nwritten as a series of self-contained sections and filled with classic and fresh anecdotes, thoughtful examples, and interesting analogies, the pragmatic programmer illustrates the best approaches and major pitfalls of many different aspects of software development. whether you're a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you'll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. you'll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career.",

        "description": "c++ is an object-oriented enhancement of the c programming language and is becoming the language of choice for serious software development. c++ has crossed the single book complexity barrier. the individual features are not all that complex, but when put together in a program they interact in highly non-intuitive ways. many books discuss each of the features separately, giving readers the illusion that they understand the language. but when they try to program, they're in for a painful surprise. c++: the core language is for c programmers transitioning to c++. it's designed to get readers up to speed quickly by covering an essential subset of the language. the subset consists of features without which it's just not c++, and a handful of others that make it a reasonably useful language. you can actually use this subset (using any compiler) to get familiar with the basics of the language. once you really understand that much, it's time to do some programming and learn more from other books. after reading this book, you'll be far better equipped to get something useful out of a reference manual, a graphical user interface programming book, and maybe a book on the specific libraries you'll be using. c++: the core language includes sidebars that give overviews of all the advanced features not covered, so that readers know they exist and how they fit in. it covers features common to all c++ compilers, including those on unix, windows nt, windows, dos, and macintosh.",

        "description": "you've completed a basic python programming tutorial or finished al sweigart's best selling automate the boring stuff with python. what's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer?\n\r\nwelcome to beyond the basic stuff with python. more than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the big-o algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. the skills you learn will boost your ability to program - not just in python but in any language.\n\r\nyou'll learn:\r\n- coding style, and how to use python's black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code;\r\n- common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers;\r\n- how to structure the files in your code projects with the cookiecutter template tool;\r\n- functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions;\r\n- how to profile the speed of your code with python's built-in timeit and cprofile modules;\r\n- the computer science behind big-o algorithm analysis;\r\n- how to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them;\r\n- how to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code.\n\r\ntoward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the tower of hanoi (a logic puzzle) and four-in-a-row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. you'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself.\n\r\nof course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. but beyond the basic stuff with python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer in the process as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly pythonic.",
